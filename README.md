Throughout the project, you'll:

Count the total number of words in the paragraph.
Filter out unnecessary words.
Correct misspelled words.
Replace inappropriate words with more suitable alternatives.
Check and validate the length of each word.
Join the improved words back into a coherent paragraph.
